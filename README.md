# list and tuple operations and special syntax

iterating through a list of tuples
```
for name,phone in listOfTuples:
  if name == a_name:
    return phone

listOfTuples = [
  ("name1", "555-555-5555"),
  ("name2", "666-666-6666"),
]
```

# underscores

# `__init__`
initializer; initializes class instance (self) so that it's ready for use

```
class Vector:
  def __init__(self,x,y):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y
    
>>> v
<__main__.Vector at 0x7fb66e8cca10>
>>> v = Vector(4,5)
>>> v.x
4
>>> v.y
5
```


# [zip](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#zip)
takes in multiple sequences and combines them into tuples
```
>>> keys = ["foobar", "barzz", "ba!"]
>>> dict(zip(keys, map(len,keys)))
{'foobar': 6, 'barzz': 5, 'ba!': 3}
```
